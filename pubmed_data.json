[{"title": "Enhancing fall risk assessment: instrumenting vision with deep learning during walks.", "summary": "Falls are common in a range of clinical cohorts, where routine risk assessment often comprises subjective visual observation only. Typically, observational assessment involves evaluation of an individual's gait during scripted walking protocols within a lab to identify deficits that potentially increase fall risk, but subtle deficits may not be (readily) observable. Therefore, objective approaches (e.g., inertial measurement units, IMUs) are useful for quantifying high resolution gait characteristics, enabling more informed fall risk assessment by capturing subtle deficits. However, IMU-based gait instrumentation alone is limited, failing to consider participant behaviour and details within the environment (e.g., obstacles). Video-based eye-tracking glasses may provide additional insight to fall risk, clarifying how people traverse environments based on head and eye movements. Recording head and eye movements can provide insights into how the allocation of visual attention to environmental stimuli influences successful navigation around obstacles. Yet, manual review of video data to evaluate head and eye movements is time-consuming and subjective. An automated approach is needed but none currently exists. This paper proposes a deep learning-based object detection algorithm (VARFA) to instrument vision and video data during walks, complementing instrumented gait."}, {"title": "The Impact of Non-Pain Factors on Pain Interference among U.S. Service Members and Veterans with Symptoms of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.", "summary": "U.S. Service members and Veterans (SM/V) experience elevated rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI), chronic pain, and other non-pain symptoms. However, the role of non-pain factors on pain interference levels remains unclear among SM/Vs, particularly those with a history of TBI. The primary objective of this study was to identify factors that differentiate high/low pain interference given equivalent pain intensity among U.S. SM/V participating in the ongoing LIMBIC-CENC national multicenter prospective longitudinal observational study. An explainable machine learning was used to identify key predictors of pain interference conditioned on equivalent pain intensity. The final sample consisted of N=1,577 SM/V who were predominantly male (87%), and 83.6% had a history of mild TBI(s), while 16.4% were TBI negative controls. The sample was categorized according to pain interference level (Low: 19.9%, Moderate: 52.5%, and High: 27.6%). Both pain intensity scores and pain interference scores increased with number of mild TBIs (p<0.001), and there was evidence of a dose response between number of injuries and pain scores. Machine learning models identified fatigue and anxiety as the most important predictors of pain interference, while emotional control was protective. Partial dependence plots identified marginal effects of fatigue and anxiety were associated with pain interference (p<0.001), but the marginal effect of mild TBI was not significant in models considering all variables (p>0.05). Non-pain factors are associated with functional limitations and disability experience among SM/V with mild TBI history. The functional effects of pain may be mediated through multiple other factors. Pain is a multidimensional experience that may benefit most from holistic treatment approaches that target comorbidities and build supports that promote recovery."}, {"title": "Unveiling the Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Review.", "summary": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most widespread endocrine and metabolic disorders affecting women of reproductive age.

However, accurate genetic testing requires a sufficient amount of tumor cells in the specimen. The evaluation of tumor content ratio (TCR) from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images has been found to vary between pathologists, making it an important challenge to obtain an accurate TCR. In this study, three pathologists exhaustively labeled all cells in 41 regions from 41 lung cancer cases as either tumor, non-tumor or indistinguishable, thus establishing a \"gold standard\" TCR. We then compared the accuracy of the TCR estimated by 13 pathologists based on visual assessment and the TCR calculated by an AI model that we have developed. It is a compact and fast model that follows a fully convolutional neural network architecture and produces cell detection maps which can be efficiently post-processed to obtain tumor and non-tumor cell counts from which TCR is calculated. Its raw cell detection accuracy is 92% while its classification accuracy is 84%. The results show that the error between the gold standard TCR and the AI calculation was significantly smaller than that between the gold standard TCR and the pathologist's visual assessment (p<0.05). Additionally, the robustness of AI models across institutions is a key issue and we demonstrate that the variation in AI was smaller than that in the average of pathologists when evaluated by institution. These findings suggest that the accuracy of tumor cellularity assessments in clinical workflows is significantly improved by the introduction of robust AI models, leading to more efficient genetic testing and ultimately to better patient outcomes."}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence in Point-of-Care Biosensing: Challenges and Opportunities.", "summary": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into point-of-care (POC) biosensing has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic methodologies by offering rapid, accurate, and accessible health assessment directly at the patient level.

Traditionally, tumor diagnosis relies on visual analysis of medical imaging and invasive biopsies for precise grading. As an alternative, computer-assisted methods, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), have gained traction. This research paper explores the recent advancements in DCNNs for glioma grading using brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from 2015 to 2023. The study evaluated various DCNN architectures and their performance, revealing remarkable results with models such as hybrid and ensemble based DCNNs achieving accuracy levels of up to 98.91%. However, challenges persisted in the form of limited datasets, lack of external validation, and variations in grading formulations across diverse literature sources. Addressing these challenges through expanding datasets, conducting external validation, and standardizing grading formulations can enhance the performance and reliability of DCNNs in glioma grading, thereby advancing brain tumor classification and extending its applications to other neurological disorders."}, {"title": "Involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation - differences and similarities between patients detained under the mental health act and according to the legal guardianship legislation.", "summary": "Involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation occurs under different legal premises.

Thus, accurate monitoring of developmental trajectories is critical. However, such monitoring often relies on time-intensive assessments which necessitate administration by skilled professionals. This difficulty is exacerbated in low-resource settings where such professionals are predominantly concentrated in urban and often private clinics, making them inaccessible to many. This geographic and economic inaccessibility contributes to a significant 'detection gap' where many children who might benefit from support remain undetected. The Scalable Transdiagnostic Early Assessment of Mental Health (STREAM) project aims to bridge this gap by developing an open-source, scalable, tablet-based platform administered by non-specialist workers to assess motor, social and cognitive developmental status. The goal is to deploy STREAM through public health initiatives, maximising opportunities for effective early interventions."}, {"title": "Other possible perspectives for solving the negative outcome penalty paradox in the application of artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostics.", "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI), represented by machine learning, artificial neural networks and deep learning, is impacting all areas of medicine, including translational research (from bench to bedside to health policy), clinical medicine (including diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and healthcare resource allocation) and public health.

This study meticulously examined clinical, microbiological, and molecular aspects related to in-hospital mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) bloodstream infections (BSI). From 292 isolates, 153 cases were scrutinized, reidentified through MALDI-TOF-MS, and evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility and carbapenemase genes via multiplex PCR. Utilizing supervised machine learning, the study constructed models to predict 14-day and 30-day mortality rates, revealing the Na\u00efve Bayes model's superior specificity (0.75) and area under the curve (AUC; 0.822) for 14-day mortality, and the Random Forest model's impressive recall (0.85) for 30-day mortality. These models delineated 8 and 9 significant features for 14-day and 30-day mortality predictions, respectively, with 'septic shock' as a pivotal variable. Additional variables such as neutropenia with neutropenic days prior to sepsis, mechanical ventilator support, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure were also identified as ranking features. However, empirical antibiotic therapy appropriateness and specific microbiological data had minimal predictive efficacy. This research offers foundational data for assessing mortality risks associated with CRAB BSI and underscores the importance of stringent infection control practices in the wake of the scarcity of new effective antibiotics against resistant strains.

Rationale for personalized approach.", "summary": "Arterial hypertension represents the most important cardiovascular risk factor with a direct responsibility for a large share of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the world. Despite the wide availability of antihypertensive therapies with documented effectiveness, blood pressure control still remains largely unsatisfactory in large segments of the population. Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension suggest the preferential use of five classes of drugs-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers-recommending the use of combination therapy, preferably in pre-established combinations, for the majority of hypertensive patients. The evidence of a non-negligible heterogeneity in the response to different antihypertensive drugs in different patients suggests the opportunity for personalization of treatment. The notable phenotypic heterogeneity of the population of hypertensive patients in terms of genetic structure, behavioural aspects, exposure to environmental factors, and disease history imposes the need to consider all the potential determinants of the response to a specific pharmacological treatment. The progressive digitalization of healthcare systems is making enormous quantities of data available for machine learning systems which will allow the development of management algorithms for truly personalized antihypertensive therapy in the near future."}, {"title": "Interpretable molecular encodings and representations for machine learning tasks.", "summary": "Molecular encodings and their usage in machine learning models have demonstrated significant breakthroughs in biomedical applications, particularly in the classification of peptides and proteins.

Both rapid identification and rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing of Mtb are essential for effective patient treatment and combating antimicrobial resistance. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, culture-free, and antibiotic incubation-free drug susceptibility test for TB using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning. We collect few-to-single-cell Raman spectra from over 25,000 cells of the Mtb complex strain Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) resistant to one of the four mainstay anti-TB drugs, isoniazid, rifampicin, moxifloxacin, and amikacin, as well as a pan-susceptible wildtype strain.

The timely identification of malaria parasites is a challenging and chaotic endeavor for health staff. An expert technician examines the schematic blood smears of infected red blood cells through a microscope. The conventional methods for identifying malaria are not efficient. Machine learning approaches are effective for simple classification challenges but not for complex tasks. Furthermore, machine learning involves rigorous feature engineering to train the model and detect patterns in the features.

Despite advancements in medical care, hip fractures impose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems. This paper focuses on the prediction of hip fracture risk in older and middle-aged adults, where falls and compromised bone quality are predominant factors. We propose a novel staged model that combines advanced imaging and clinical data to improve predictive performance. By using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from hip DXA images, along with clinical variables, shape measurements, and texture features, our method provides a comprehensive framework for assessing fracture risk. The study cohort included 547 patients, with 94 experiencing hip fracture. A staged machine learning-based model was developed using two ensemble models: Ensemble 1 (clinical variables only) and Ensemble 2 (clinical variables and DXA imaging features). This staged approach used uncertainty quantification from Ensemble 1 to decide if DXA features are necessary for further prediction. Ensemble 2 exhibited the highest performance, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.9541, an accuracy of 0.9195, a sensitivity of 0.8078, and a specificity of 0.9427.
